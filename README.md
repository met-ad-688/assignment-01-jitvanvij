# Assignment-01
In Assignment 1, we performed the following tasks:

a. Initially, we created and configured EC2 instances.
b. Afterward, we connected to the EC2 instance via SSH and VS Code.
c. Upon successfully connecting to the EC2 virtual machine, we set up a remote Jupyter notebook server on the EC2 instance.
d. Once we were comfortable with the environment, we explored how to use shell commands to gather system and environment information.
e. After becoming familiar with shell commands, we wrote a shell script using nano to count the number of lines containing the word "python" in a CSV file.
f. Subsequently, using Python, we wrote a script to count the lines containing the word "GitHub" in a Stack Overflow post.

Instructions for running the scripts:
a. To execute the shell script that counts the number of lines with the word "python" in a CSV file, ensure that the CSV file is in the correct directory. Then, run the following command in your terminal:
./count_python.sh
After a few seconds, the result will appear in your terminal.

b. To run the script that counts the number of lines with "GitHub" in a post, ensure the _output folder is in the Assignment 1 repository. Then, open the file count_github.py and execute the script. This process may take a little longer, but after a few minutes, you will see the result in your terminal.
